# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some inforation about this project
 This is a full stack webpage , where React.js is used for front-end development , node.js for back-end server , and postgresql for database .
 <br />
 
 ### Front End part 
    The design of the webpage is based on the typical amazon webpage.  
<br /> 
    User would be able to :
                            1. login/create account 
                            2. Add/delete items 
                            3. modify existing items
                            4. "Buy" the items inside the shopping cart
    <br/>
  ### Back End part 
    The backend part is mainly developed by node.js.
    Mostly RESTFUL apis for different purposes(add/delete items , add icons ....)
  
 
 ### NOTE
 This is just for demo purposes , the site is probably not gonna work on other machine since the postgre server is hosted on my own machine. Please contact me if you really interested in it.
 
### `npm start`
